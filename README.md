# ⏯ iPlayer
Offline initutive music player.

> **NOTE:** iPlayer is in BETA. It may be cool or useful, but it also may have big pain-in-the-ahh issues.

## 💡 Comparison with other apps
iPlayer is a music player-it doesn't display video and runs in the background.
Most media players don't focus on it; they rather simply play the content, don't customize to it.

Here's a table that compares some of the features:

|          Feature          |   iPlayer  |       VLC      |      Spotify      |      YT Music      |
|---------------------------|------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Picture-in-Picture widget | ✅        | ❌             | ✅                | ❌                |
| Background playing        | ✅        | 🟨 has issues  | ✅                | ✅                |
| Streaming                 | ❌        | ❌             | ✅                | ✅                |
| Downloading               | ❌ (soon) | ❌             | 🟦 (with premium) | 🟦 (with premium) |
| Offline usage             | ✅        | ✅             | ✅                | ❌                |

And here's some of the bugs/issues/pmo-s between them: (piss-me-offs)

|         Issue         |          iPlayer         | VLC |        Spotify        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|-----|-----------------------|
| Lag / bad performance | 🟡 (on very low-end pcs) | ❌  | 🔴                   |
| Ads                   | ❌                       | ❌  | 🔴 (without premium) |

Also, iPlayer doesn't have phone support; you probably wouldn't use it anyway.
Some phones have built-in offline music players, e.g. Xiaomi - so it would also probably be unnecessary.
